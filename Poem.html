<h2 class="maybe"> Maybe
Maybe the world will heal again before I will depart
Maybe love can heal our wounds, if only we let it play a part
Maybe the lesson I need to learn will not be hard to see,
if only I open myself up to the possibility
Maybe life is just a dream and I’ve been sleeping too long
Maybe when I wake this time it’s to a brand new song
Maybe all of this is bullshit just to ease my soul 
but maybe just maybe
it's a message
That’s been to me unfold</h2>

A story of love
We are the women whose  blood  runs through the veins of the misunderstood, misdiagnosed and all  those  mis-aligned by this injustice  system. 

those of us who have figured out that we have  in some form or fashion or reason being.
 missed the boat some how  and in some way  or missed out on  the best of our lives  or something in our lives - 
only to have found a pathway to healing and redemption with our sisters in a , 
dissolute, desolate, dark, and barren place, devoid of compassion, that we have transformed 
We fermented our hurts into a beautiful garden filled with the light we've shown upon one another to nurture  and heal, to run our fingers over all the scars
 and---- 
we  found  beauty and strength in one another. In our stories -  in our lives
 We found honor and loyalty , 
we found  courage and dignity, 
we found each other and watered , pruned, and shifted the dirt from time to time 
so that our seeds could blossom and stretch towards the light as we  grow 
 tall and strong and give birth to a collective
 that gives birth to ideas 
that gives birth to movements 
that give birth to the causes of who we are  
and what we understand to be truth -
women 
women  on the move, 
women  changing the narrative , 
women challenging the status quo , 
changing our lives with  other women 
and the lives of everyone we touch 
as we love on  one another , 
so we can love one another ,
 till we can  all love one another 
and,  keep loving one another.
 This is A story of LOVE!!!!

United souls sisters 
We are a fierce collection of women , as diverse as a bag of party mix, so unapologetic for who we are and so brave and powerful for what we believe. I acknowledge each and everyone of you for the riches you have brought into my life, your wisdom and strengths that you so unselfishly share with me. You are beautiful bodacious creators of prose and poetry that ebbs and flows from your minds onto paper into the words that bond us on this wonderful writing adventure. I thank you , I appreciate you , I love you!!!  United Soul Sisters-
